/**
 * 710. Random Pick with Blacklist
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-blacklist/
 *
 * Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to
 * return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B.
 *
 * Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().
 *
 * Note:
 * 1 <= N <= 1000000000
 * 0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)
 * [0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
 * [[1,[]],[],[],[]]
 * Output: [null,0,0,0]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
 * [[2,[]],[],[],[]]
 * Output: [null,1,1,1]
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input:
 * ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
 * [[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
 * Output: [null,0,0,2]
 *
 * Example 4:
 * Input:
 * ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
 * [[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
 * Output: [null,1,3,1]
 * Explanation of Input Syntax:
 *
 * The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's
 * constructor has two arguments, N and the blacklist B. pick has no arguments.
 * Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
