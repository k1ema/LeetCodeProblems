/**
 * 1192. Critical Connections in a Network
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/
 *
 * There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections
 * forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b.
 * Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.
 *
 * A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some
 * other server.
 *
 * Return all critical connections in the network in any order.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * 1 â€” 2
 * | \ |
 * 3   0
 *
 * Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
 * Output: [[1,3]]
 * Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
 * connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
 * There are no repeated connections.

                //   node is an ancestor of neighbor, so neighbor=>node is a back edge, meaning at that time it already
                //   detected that there is a cycle between neighbor and node, so that edge would not be included in the result.
