    in comments there is bephrem explanation of number of result strings

    all decompositions of a string â‰  all the sub-strings of a string
    The number of substrings of a string is n(n+1)/2. There are 2^(n-1) decompositions of a string (no constraints on how we decompose the string, we just break the string up however we choose as long as we exhaust all possibilities).

    Example:
    n = 3
    "abc"

    Substrings: (3)((3)+1)/2 = 6
    [ "a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", "abc" ]

    Decompositions: 2^((3)-1) = 4
    [ [ "a", "b", "c" ], [ "a", "bc" ], [ "ab" ,"c"], [ "abc" ] ]

    ...wait...why 2^(n-1) decompositions. Well an intuitive explanation is that of CHOICE.

    Remember how for a set of size n we have 2^n subsets? This is because for n elements we can do 2 THINGS, choose that element to put it in the final subset, or NOT choose that element to put it in the final subset.

    Same principle here except we have 2 choices for n - 1 PARTITION POINTS.

    For example:

    n = 3
    "abc"

    I have 2 PARTITION POINTS that I can make 2 choices on: USE IT or DON'T USE IT. So as follows:

    "a | b | c"

    Do you see those split points?

    If I use the first and second I get [ "a", "b", "c"]
    If I use just the first I get [ "a", "bc"]
    If I use just the second I get [ "ab", "c"]
    If I don't use both I get [ "abc"]

    I hope this clears it up. If not keep asking more questions.
