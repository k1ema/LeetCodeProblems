/**
 * 274. H-Index
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/
 *
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
 * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers
 * have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
 *              received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
 *              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
 *              two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
 *
 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
